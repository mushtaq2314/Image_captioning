# Image Captioning Model with CNN + Transformer
# This repository contains an advanced image captioning model built with TensorFlow and Keras, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder and a Transformer-based decoder. The model can generate meaningful captions for images by learning from a dataset of images paired with textual descriptions.
# 
# Model Architecture
# The image captioning model architecture combines three major components:
# 
# CNN Encoder - A modified InceptionV3 model that extracts visual features from an image.
# Transformer Encoder Layer - Applies multi-head self-attention and normalization to enhance the image features.
# Transformer Decoder Layer - Generates captions based on image features and previously generated words, using a causal mask to prevent the model from looking ahead in the sequence.
# Components
# CNN Encoder (CNN_Encoder):
# The encoder utilizes InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet to extract spatial features from an input image. The output is reshaped to feed into the Transformer encoder.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# def CNN_Encoder():
#     inception_v3 = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
#     inception_v3.trainable = False
#     output = tf.keras.layers.Reshape((-1, output.shape[-1]))(inception_v3.output)
#     cnn_model = tf.keras.models.Model(inception_v3.input, output)
#     return cnn_model
# Transformer Encoder Layer (TransformerEncoderLayer): This layer processes the CNN encoder’s output by applying multi-head self-attention and layer normalization to capture interdependencies between different spatial locations of the image features.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# class TransformerEncoderLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
#     def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.layer_norm_1 = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization()
#         self.attention = tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim)
#         self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(embed_dim, activation="relu")
# Transformer Decoder Layer (TransformerDecoderLayer): The decoder layer applies multi-head attention over the encoder outputs and generated tokens, along with feed-forward layers and dropout for regularization.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# class TransformerDecoderLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
#     def __init__(self, embed_dim, units, num_heads):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.attention_1 = tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim)
#         self.attention_2 = tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim)
#         self.ffn_layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation="relu")
#         self.out = tf.keras.layers.Dense(tokenizer.vocabulary_size(), activation="softmax")
# Model Structure
# The ImageCaptioningModel class integrates the CNN encoder, Transformer encoder, and Transformer decoder. It computes the loss and accuracy, applying a mask to ignore padding tokens.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# class ImageCaptioningModel(tf.keras.Model):
#     def __init__(self, cnn_model, encoder, decoder, image_aug=None):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.cnn_model = cnn_model
#         self.encoder = encoder
#         self.decoder = decoder
#         # Additional components for loss and accuracy tracking.
# Training Strategy
# The model is trained with sparse categorical cross-entropy, using an early stopping callback to prevent overfitting. A learning rate of 
# 1
# ×
# 1
# 0
# −
# 5
# 1×10 
# −5
#   with gradient clipping is applied to stabilize training.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# caption_model.compile(
#     optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5, clipvalue=1.0),
#     loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False, reduction="none")
# )
# 
# history = caption_model.fit(
#     train_dataset,
#     epochs=50,
#     validation_data=val_dataset,
#     callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)]
# )
# Training Data
# The model requires a training dataset consisting of images and their corresponding captions. Each batch of data consists of an image and a caption sequence, where the model learns to predict the next word in the sequence based on the image features and previous words.
# 
# Usage
# Clone the repository:
# bash
